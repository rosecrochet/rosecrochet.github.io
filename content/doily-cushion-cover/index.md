Crocheting is such a versatile craft that with little imagination and knowledge about stitches,any one can create beautiful things . I made this cushion cover with a doily in center. My own design. Doily pattern is from net. I changed the pattern to make it suitable for this  design. The square part of the cushion cover is done with shell pattern , Overall it gives a artistic look.
